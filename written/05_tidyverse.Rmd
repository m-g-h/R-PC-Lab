  - Before beginning data analysis, the data to be analysed has to be loaded into the R environment. There are several ways to do so:
    1. Manually enter data in R (not recommended)
    2. Loading data from other formats such as .csv, .txt, .sav (SPSS), etc.
    3. Working with databases (not covered here)
    4. Using inbuilt datasets

## Entering Data manually

  - Example for the first method:
```{r echo=TRUE}
student_name <- c("Hans", "Peter",
                  "Anna", "Hanna") # Creating a vector of names
student_sex <- c("m", "m", "w", "w") # Creating a vector of sexes
student_grade <- c(2.3, 3.8, 1.2, 2.2) # Creating a vector of grades
# Merging the three vectors into a data frame
student_df <- data.frame(name=student_name, sex=student_sex, 
                         grade=student_grade) 
print(student_df)
```

## Inbuilt datasets
 - R also has lots of inbuilt datasets, of which the most famous ones are:
    - `mtcars`: Motor Trend Car Road Tests
    - `iris`: Edgar Anderson's Iris Data
 - The inbuilt datasets are easily accessed by just calling them. A complete list is available by calling `library(help="datasets")`

```{r echo = TRUE}
mydf <- mtcars # assigning the mtcars to the variable 'df'
head(mydf[,1:6],4) # Printing the first 5 rows (and 6 columns)
```


## Importing data
 - The most common situation is that you have an existing format in another file format. Usually, those are comma-separated text files (CSV) or datasets processed by other statistical software.
 - To import data from other formats, we need to specifiy in R from which format we are reading. In the case of CSV, this is simple:
```{r echo =TRUE}
mydf <- read.csv("data/class_data_comma.csv") # Reading data from csv
names(mydf) <- c("Name", "Studies", "Study_hours", # Assigning
                 "Alevels", "Stat_know", "Prosp_Grade") # new column names
head(mydf, 3)
```

---

 - But look what happens if we try to read the semicolon-separated file:
```{r echo = TRUE, error=TRUE}
mydf <- read.csv("data/class_data_semi.csv")
```
 - We need to tell R the separator of the single data table cells from each other. For csv, the remedy for semicolon-separated files is simple:
```{r echo = TRUE}
mydf <- read.csv2("data/class_data_semi.csv")
names(mydf) <- c("Name", "Studies", "Study_hours",
                 "Alevels", "Stat_know", "Prosp_Grade"); head(mydf, 3)
```

---

 - To finish this chapter, we import data from the SPSS file format .sav. Since base R does not have a function to handle this format, we will need the `haven` library.
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(haven)
mydf <- read_spss("data/democracy.sav") # Loading the Democracy dataset
# Selecting only three variables
mydf <- subset(mydf, select=c("Nation", "Religion", "Catholic"))
head(mydf, 3)
```
 - Here, we are selecting three variables using the `subset` command because the Democracy dataset comprises 2787 variables.

# The Tidyverse

---

 - The tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science.
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Organising Data in a standardized way
"tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way"
- Hadley Wickham

And that's why we want tidy data!
![](figure/tidy.png)
<br />




## Data Management using the tidyverse
 - As you can see, the tidyverse loads a list of packages:
    - `ggplot` for graphics
    - `tibble` for cooler dataframes
    - `tidyr` for data tidying
    - `readr` for importing data
    - `purrr` for functional programming
    - `dplyr` for data manipulation
    - `stringr` for string manipulation
    - `forcats` for easier factor handling.
 - In this tutorial, we will use the `flights` dataset from the `nycflights13` package.

## The Pipe
 - A central operator within the tidyverse is the "pipe" operator `%>%`
 - The pipe takes an input in front of it and pushes it in the function that follows after the pipe. It is effectively acting like a Pipe. It can also be imagined like an assembly line.
 - $f(g(x))$ is the same as
```{r error=TRUE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x %>% g() %>% f()
```

---

```{r echo = TRUE, results = FALSE}
tutors <- c("Bene", "Marcel", "Martin", "Ben")
```
<div class="column-left">
 - Standard nested functions
```{r echo = TRUE}
length(tutors)
nchar(tutors)
max(nchar(tutors))
```
</div>
<div class="column-right">
 - Using the pipe
```{r echo = TRUE}
tutors %>% length()
tutors %>% nchar()
tutors %>% nchar() %>% max()
```
</div>

---

 - Let us have a quick look at a better dataframe format. Instead of using base R's `data.frame()`, we will use dplyr's `data_frame()`.
 
```{r echo = TRUE}
mydf <- data_frame(name=c("Hans", "Peter", "Anna", "Hanna"),
                   sex=c("m", "m", "w", "w"),
                   grade = c(2.3, 3.8, 1.2, 2.2))
```
<div class="column-left">
```{r}
# Print the dataframe
head(mydf, 2)
```
</div>
<div class="column-right">
```{r echo = TRUE}
# Checking dimensions
mydf %>% dim() # (rows x cols)
```
</div>
<div style="clear:both;">
```{r echo = TRUE}
mydf %>% glimpse() # Get a glimpse of the dataframe
```
</div>

 - The pipe gives us the possibility to make our code more readable, but it does not really make things necessarily easier right now, at least not for data manipulation.
 - This is where `dplyr`'s functions come into play:
    - `filter()` filters the rows of a table by one or more conditions
    - `select()` selects the specified columns
    - `mutate()` creates new variables or changes existing ones
    - `arrange()` sorts by a column
    - `group_by()` enables data manipulation of groups within the dataframe
 - Now let's do some data manipulation!
 
## `filter()`
<div style="float:left;width:60%;">
```{r echo=T}
(x <- data_frame(id=c(1:7), 
                 group=c(rep(c("a","b"),3),"a")))
```
</div><div style="float:right;width:40%;">
```{r echo=T}
x %>% 
  filter(group=="a")
```
</div><div style="clear:both">
 - The `filter()` command filters row-wise according to one or more criteria. Criteria can be linked by using either the "OR" operator `|` or the "AND" operator `&`.
</div>

## `select()`
<div style="float:left;width:60%;">
```{r echo=T}
x %>% select(group)
```
</div><div style="float:right;width:40%;">
```{r echo=T}
x %>% select(-group)
```
</div><div style="clear:both">
 - The `select()` command selects columns as specified. Selecting multiple columns is done by separating the column names with commas. Deselecting columns using a "-" like in the example is also possible. `startswith()` can be useful when selecting multiple variables with the same prefix.
</div>

## `mutate()`
<div class="column-left">
```{r echo=T}
x %>% mutate(log_id=log(id))
```
</div><div class="column-right">
```{r echo=T}
x %>% mutate(group=ifelse(id<=4, "a", "b"))
```
</div><div style="clear:both">
 - The `mutate()` command creates new variables or changes existing ones. Like in the example, existing variables can be part of the new variable declaration. In the example, for the new variable "log_id" each row of the id column is logarithmised. With `ifelse()`, it is possible to mutate variables on a condition.
</div>

## `arrange()`
<div style="float:left;width:60%;">
```{r echo=T}
x %>% arrange(group)
```
</div><div style="float:right;width:40%;">
```{r echo=T}
x %>% arrange(desc(id))
```
</div><div style="clear:both">
 - The `arrange()` command sorts the dataframe by the specified column. calling `desc()` on the column will make `arrange()` sorting in descending order. Hierarchical sorting is possible by passing more than one variable into `arrange()`.
</div>

## `group_by()`
<div style="float:left;width:50%;">
```{r echo=T}
x %>% group_by(group) %>%
  mutate(no_obs=n())
```
</div><div style="float:right;width:50%;">
```{r echo=T}
x %>% group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(sum_id=sum(id))
```
</div><div style="clear:both">
 - Grouping variables is useful if operations should be executed group-wise. The `n()` command counts the rows in the current group context. `summarise()` summarises information in the current group context with the given function.
</div>

## Exercise Time
 - Now open and solve the tidyverse introduction exercises!

## Example using `dplyr` and pipes
```{r echo=T}
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13) # Loading the flights dataset
flights %>% glimpse(width = 80)
```

The beauty of dplyr becomes apparent when performing operation like the following.

```{r echo=T, results=F}
flights %>% 
  select(-arr_time, -dep_time, 
         -sched_dep_time, -sched_arr_time) %>%  # Dropping columns
  filter(distance >= 500) %>%  # Selecting flights with at least 500 miles distance
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%  # Selecting flights where delay information is available
  group_by(carrier) %>% # Grouping by carrier
  summarise(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>% # Calculating the mean arrival
                                              # delay for each carrier
  arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>% # arrange by delay in descending order
  mutate(punctual = ifelse(mean_delay<5, # Create a new variable "punctual" and assign
                           "usually on time", # "on time" if mean delay is less than 5
                           "usually delayed")) %>%  # and "delayed", if it is greater
  filter(punctual == "usually on time") %>% # keep only the carriers that are on time
  arrange(mean_delay) # ...and sort them in ascending order
```

---

```{r echo=F}
flights %>% 
  select(-arr_time, -dep_time, 
         -sched_dep_time, -sched_arr_time) %>%  # Dropping columns
  filter(distance >= 500) %>%  # Selecting flights with at least 500 miles distance
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%  # Selecting flights where delay information is available
  group_by(carrier) %>% # Grouping by carrier
  summarise(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>% # Calculating the mean arrival
                                              # delay for each carrier
  arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>% # arrange by delay in descending order
  mutate(punctual = ifelse(mean_delay<5, # Create a new variable "punctual" and assign
                           "usually on time", # "on time" if mean delay is less than 5
                           "usually delayed")) %>%  # and "delayed", if it is greater
  filter(punctual == "usually on time") %>% # keep only the carriers that are on time
  arrange(mean_delay) # ...and sort them in ascending order
```

- To understand the whole procedure step by step, it is advisable to execute the code line by line, excluding the concluding `%>%` for each line.

- **Exercise**: Open the tidyverse assignment sheet. See if you can solve it using the `%>%` operator and the `dplyr` commands!

## Dplyr commands
```{r echo=T, results=F}
flights %>% 
  select(-arr_time, -dep_time, 
         -sched_dep_time, -sched_arr_time) %>%  # Dropping columns
  filter(distance >= 500) %>%  # Selecting flights with at least 500 miles distance
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%  # Selecting flights where delay information is available
  group_by(carrier) %>% # Grouping by carrier
  summarise(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>% # Calculating the mean arrival
                                              # delay for each carrier
  arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>% # arrange by delay in descending order
  mutate(punctual = ifelse(mean_delay<5, # Create a new variable "punctual" and assign
                           "usually on time", # "on time" if mean delay is less than 5
                           "usually delayed")) %>%  # and "delayed", if it is greater
  filter(punctual == "usually on time") %>% # keep only the carriers that are on time
  arrange(mean_delay) # ...and sort them in ascending order
```
