# Random Variables

## A few notational remarks
 - Notational Remarks ($X$ or $x_i$, and what about $Y$?)
    - $X$ is a random variable, $x$ is a particular outcome.

## Discrete and continuous random variables
Discrete random variables are variables which can only take a countable number of values. For example, throwing a  die represents a random variable.  
Let $D$ be a random variable with outcomes $j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, then:
$p_j = P(D = d_j), j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, and  
$p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_6 = 1$.  
This reads "The Probability of $D$ to take $d_j$ is $p_j$". Each $p_j$ is between $0$ and $1$ and all of them add up to $1$. If the die is fair, each $p_j$ is $\frac{1}{6}$
